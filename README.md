based on otouto

Suzzy is an independently-developed Telegram API bot written in Lua. Originally conceived as a CLI script in February of 2015, Suzzy has since been open-sourced and migrated to the API, and is being developed to this day.

## Setup {#Setup}
You _must_ have Lua (5.2+), lua-socket, lua-sec, and lua-cjson installed. To upload files, you must have curl installed.
`sudo apt-get install lua5.2 lua-socket lua-sec`

To use fortune.lua, you must have fortune installed.

**Before doing anything**
open config.lua and set `bot_api_key` to the authentication token you received from the Botfather.


You may want to set: `admin`, your Telegram ID; `time_offset`, a positive or negative number, denoting the difference, in seconds, of your system clock to UTC; and `lang`, a lowercase, two-letter code representing your language.
If you want to add and enable a plugins , add them to the `plugins` folder and `plugins `table in `config.lua` (before help.lua) if you set this after `help.lua` plugin not shows in help message

To start the bot, run `./launch.sh`. To stop the bot, send "/halt" from your admin account, and then Ctrl+C out of the loop. If you terminate the bot manually, you risk data loss. If you do not wish the bot to restart automatically, run it with `lua bot.lua`.

Note that certain plugins, such as translate.lua and greetings.lua, will require privacy mode to be disabled. Additionally, some plugins may require or make use of various API keys:

 - weather.lua: [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org) API key
 - cats.lua: [The Cat API](http://thecatapi.com) API key (optional)
 - gImages.lua: [Google](http://console.developers.google.com) API and CSE keys
 - translate.lua: [Yandex](https://tech.yandex.com/keys/get/?service=trnsl) API key

## Style {#Style}
Bot output from every plugin should follow a consistent style. This style is easily observed interacting with the bot.
Titles should be either **bold** (along with their colons) or a [link](http://otou.to) (with plaintext colons) to the content's source. Names should be _italic_. Numbered lists should use bold numbers followed by a bold period followed by a space. Unnumbered lists should use the â€¢ bullet point followed by a space. Descriptions and information should be in plaintext, although "flavor" text should be italic. Technical information should be `monospace`. Links should be named.
